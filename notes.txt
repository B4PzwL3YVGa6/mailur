All of my email is in Postgres. Ever heard of the IMAP server called Archiveopteryx?

Arnt and Ahbijit know more about the email RFCs than probably anyone else on the planet. 
Arnt has been involved in writing several RFCs himself. Aox is blazing fast and your 
mailboxes scale as large as you want. Millions of emails in a single mail folder is not a 
problem. It's also really nice that it handles deduplication of your mail at several 
levels.
