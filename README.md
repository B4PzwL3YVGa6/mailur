#### Mailur aims to become a powerful Gmail-inspired webmail.

New version is rewriting once again with [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) as a main storage. I've been researching and experimenting with Dovecot several months already and found some solutions for support tags and pretty fast thread searchers and views, hope I'll finish it someday.

**There is no complete demo yet, still work in progress.**
